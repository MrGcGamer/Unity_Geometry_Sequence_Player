## Overview:

This package for the Unity game engine allows you to playback large and complex geometric sequences. In a geometry sequence, each frame consists out of an individual mesh or pointcloud, which is then shown at short intervalls to create the illusion of a animation, kind of like a 3D flipbook. The package was orginally developed to allow playback of Volumetric Video captures, but can also be used to play any animated 3D-sequences, that are unsuitable for bone or blendshape workflows, like for example...

## Usecases:

Pointclouds                |  Meshes                  | Textured Meshes
