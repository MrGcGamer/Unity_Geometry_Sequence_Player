### Version 1.2.3

This version fixes several bugs introduced in version 1.2.2

### Version 1.2.2

This version contains several new features, contributed by [Anwar Lu](https://github.com/MrGcGamer):

- **Converter Tool MacOS support:** The converter tool now supports MacOS as well (texture compression is not yet supported)
- **Sequence Compression:** Sequences can now be compressed to around half their size!

Fixes:

- [Issue #9](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/11)
- Several small bug fixes and additions

### Version 1.2.1

This version contains a small improvement for the rendering bounds of Sequences. The bounds were not correctly calculated in previous version, leading to the sequence not being correctly culled from the camera view.

⬇️ Please also update the Geometry Sequence Player package to the newest version!

### Version 1.2.0

This version focuses mostly on improvements of the pointcloud rendering ✨

- **Custom Pointcloud Shaders**:  Custom shaders for pointclouds are now supported and can also be created with Unity Shadergraph
- **Per-Point Sizes**:  Each point of a pointcloud can now have a unique size (Shadergraph only)
- **Per-Point Normals**: Pointclouds sequences can now contain per-point normals
- **Pointcloud Normal Estimation**: If needed, pointcloud normals can now be estimated with the Converter tool
- **New sample**: A new sample that shows how to create custom shadergraphs for pointclouds
- **Per-Vertex Normals**:  Mesh sequences can now also be exported with custom per-vertex normals

⬆️ Please update to the [new Converter](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/releases), to be able to use the per-vertex normal features!

### Version 1.1.1

Fixed Issues:

- Removed unessesary using reference from sample code that was breaking builds

### Version 1.1.0

Added features:

- Huge overhaul of the playback system. Performance is enhanced by up to 10x-20x.
- Pointcloud geometry shaders have been replaced by a compute shader system
- Mac, Iphone, Ipad and VisionOS support
- Compressed .astc textures for mobile devices are now supported
- Converter Tool supports reduction of pointcloud sizes
- More reliable playback. Lags, or low framerates don't affect the playback speed anymore
- Added frame debugging/performance tools
- URP and HDRP render pipelines support
- Unity 6 support
- The package is now available on the Unity Asset Store 🙂

Fixed Issues:

[#7 "visionOS Support"](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/7)

[#5 "Pointcloud shader not working on Metal/OpenGL](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/5)

### Version 1.0.3

Added features:

- Thumbnails will now show when adding a sequence via the editor
- Looping is now much smoother and should not lag anymore
- Added Playback Events that can be used to see when a scene has been loaded, started playing ect.
- Added more refined media loading via script API
- Added Stop functionality to the player

### Version 1.0.2

Added features:

- A parent transform for the streamed mesh can be set
- Pointcloud meshes are now mirrorable
- Added better documentation in some parts
- Added Unity Test Project to the main repository

Fixed Issues:

[#6 "The transform of Streamed Meshes should be settable before going into play mode"](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/6)

[#3 "Meshes/Pointclouds are mirrored on the X-Axis"](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/3)

Releases:
[Package release v1.0.2](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Geometry_Sequence_Player_Package/releases/tag/v1.0.2)

### Version 1.0.1 (Package only)

Fixed Issues:

[#1 "Cannot build as AssetDatabase cannot be used outside the editor"](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/1)

[#2 "Android /WebGL cannot load data from StreamingAssets Path"](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/issues/2)

Releases:
[Package release v1.0.1](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Geometry_Sequence_Player_Package/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

### Version 1.0.0

Initial Release, this plugin supersedes the [Pointcloud Player Package](https://github.com/ExperimentalSurgery/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player)

[Converter release v1.0.0](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
[Package release v1.0.1](https://github.com/BuildingVolumes/Geometry_Sequence_Streaming_Package/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
